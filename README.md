# Fong's Vim Help

This is my personal Vim cheatsheet that I use to augment my feeble mind. The idea for this was [original from technosophos](https://github.com/technosophos/vim-myhelp).

## To Install

The cheatsheet gets added as a plugin. So if you use a plugin manager like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), you can add the following to your `~/.vimrc` or `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` 

```
Plug 'tinyheero/vim-myhelp'
```

Then reload plugins (or restart vim/neovim). Then you should be able to type `:h myhelp`
